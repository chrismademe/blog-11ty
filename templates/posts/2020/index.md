I feel as though I should introduce myself because, if I'm being completely honest with myself, I don't blog enough.

I'm Chris, I'm married to Ida and we have a gorgeous (almost) 2 year old son, Nico. I have an unhealthy obsession with Super Mario World ROM Hacks and I love front-end development.

Truth be told though, I feel like I'm lagging behind a bit when it comes to my professional life. I work mostly with WordPress and PHP, which I don't mind, but I want to expand my knowledge. So this posts serves as a reference to myself mainly for my goals this year.

### Learn at least 1 framework

I've always liked to have a really deep understanding of all the moving parts of my creations, and as such have sat firmly on the fence when it comes to front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte etc.

This year, I'm going to learn at least **one**. I'm not sure which one yet, I'm leaning towards React (maybe Preact) or Svelte at the moment - I like the idea that Svelte compiles down to vanilla JS.

### Blog more

Over the last 5 years as a developer I've learnt so much. I should share some of that knowledge and of course I want to document my journey into JS framework land. My initial target is 1 per month. A complete revamp and design is part of that too, since this is just a Gatsby template at the moment.

### Get a new job

This is something that's been on my mind for a while now - I'd like to work on a product. So I'm actively looking for a new role at the moment!

I'm looking for something remote, so I can spend a little more time with my family, but for the right role I'd consider commuting into London.

So that's my plan for 2020 - I'd be keen to hear about yours, I'm on Twitter [@underscoresdev](https://twitter.com/underscoresdev).
